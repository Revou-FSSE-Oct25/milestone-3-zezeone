📌 Overview

LapakShop is a simple e-commerce web application built using Next.js (App Router).
This project demonstrates modern web development concepts including:

Static Site Generation (SSG)

Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Client-Side Data Fetching

Dynamic Routing

Global State Management (Cart)

Error & Loading Handling

The application fetches product data from a public API and allows users to browse products, view details, and add items to a shopping cart.
